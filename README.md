# Imgstor

Imgstor primarily uses your Google Drive as a secure and private backup space, allowing you to easily manage and save all your precious images. Your data is under your control.

## Key Features

- **Google Drive Integration**: After logging in with your Google account, all your backup files (original images and settings) are automatically and securely stored in a dedicated "appDataFolder" within your Google Drive. This folder is hidden from users, ensuring your data's privacy and security, and is accessible only by you.

- **Powerful Tagging System**: Add custom tags to each of your images for easy categorization, searching, and management down the line.

- **Simple Format Conversion**: Offers basic image format conversion capabilities. For optimal results or more advanced options, it is recommended to use professional external conversion tools.

## How It Works

When you authorize Imgstor with your Google account, the application creates a separate, hidden "appDataFolder" in your Google Drive. All original images and personal settings are automatically saved to this folder. This design ensures that Imgstor's data does not interfere with other files in your cloud drive, while also safeguarding the privacy and security of your personal data.
